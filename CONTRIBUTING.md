# Getting started
To start mapping, please join MRT-Map's Discord server and ping @7d#5755 for the Mapper role. This role will give you access to a private channel where you can see some tutorials about mapping the server.

# Mapping and Contributing to the Main Repository
**DO NOT** push to the main branch or development branch (only 7d can cos he knows the standard :D); fork this repo and write the changes there, and also create a pull request for merging into the `development` branch. Optionally (but please do for your first time mapping), consult 7d to check if the standard is correct before pushing. Once a namespace is complete, your fork will then be merged into `main` at the discretion of 7d, and these changes will be deployed to the map itself.

**namespace list is in discord**
